Step 2: Configuration After Booting from SSD

Now that you've successfully booted your Raspberry Pi 5 from the NVMe SSD, you need to decide how you want to use the system—either as a server accessed through SSH or with the full MX Linux GUI.

Case 1: Headless Server (SSH Only)
If you plan to use your Raspberry Pi purely as a server without connecting a monitor (for example, accessing it via SSH), follow these steps:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. SSH into your Raspberry Pi
Use the IP address of your Raspberry Pi to connect via SSH. The default user and password are demo:

# ssh demo@<your-ip>

2. Fix DNS Settings
If your DNS settings reset after boot, you may need to manually configure the resolv.conf file:

sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf

Add the following lines:
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4

3. Enable SSH on Startup
Ensure SSH starts automatically on boot:

sudo systemctl enable ssh

4. Add a New User and Remove Default
Create your own user (say, tspl)and remove the default demo user:

sudo adduser tspl
sudo usermod -aG sudo tspl
sudo passwd tspl

#now exit and logback in using your new user tspl

sudo deluser demo
sudo deluser --remove-home demo

5. Enable Remote Desktop (Optional)
If you'd like to access the Raspberry Pi via remote desktop, install XRDP:

sudo apt install xrdp
sudo systemctl start xrdp
sudo systemctl enable xrdp

6. Pair Bluetooth Devices (Optional)
If you're using Bluetooth devices, set up Bluetooth through the terminal:

sudo systemctl start bluetooth
bluetoothctl

Run the following commands in bluetoothctl:

power on
agent on
scan on
pair <MAC address>
connect <MAC address>
trust <MAC address>

7. Install MPV for Media Playback (Optional)
For basic media playback on the Pi:

sudo apt install mpv

You can now check audio playback by running some music through mpv.

Important: Do not connect an HDMI monitor until you finish these steps to avoid the sound being forwarded to the HDMI device.

8. Install Pironman Software for RGB and Small Monitor Control
Create a directory for software installations:

mkdir Softwares
cd Softwares

Follow the official guide for setting up Pironman software:
https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/pironman5/en/latest/set_up/set_up_rpi_os.html

Then, install the required software:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git python3 python3-pip python3-setuptools

git clone https://github.com/sunfounder/pironman5.git
cd ~/pironman5
sudo python3 install.py

This will enable control of the RGB fans and the small monitor in the Pironman case.

Case 2: Full GUI (MX Linux)
If you plan to use your Raspberry Pi 5 with a full desktop GUI environment, connect a monitor via HDMI and follow these steps:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. Connect HDMI and Monitor
Connect the HDMI cable and power on the Raspberry Pi.
Wait for the screen to load (this can take 3-5 minutes depending on the system).
2. Follow On-Screen Instructions
After the screen loads, follow the on-screen instructions to complete the initial setup.

3. Fix DNS Settings
Once booted, if you experience DNS issues, configure the resolv.conf file:

sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf

Add the following lines:
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4

4. Enable SSH for Remote Access
To enable SSH access for remote management:

sudo systemctl enable ssh

5. Enable Remote Desktop (Optional)
Install and enable XRDP for remote desktop access:

sudo apt install xrdp
sudo systemctl start xrdp
sudo systemctl enable xrdp

6. Pair Bluetooth Devices
If you’re using a Bluetooth speaker or other Bluetooth peripherals, pair them either through the GUI:

In the desktop environment, click the speaker icon to change your audio output to either the Bluetooth device or the monitor's built-in speakers.


7. Install Pironman Software for RGB and Small Monitor Control
Create a directory for software installations:

mkdir Softwares
cd Softwares

Follow the official guide for setting up Pironman software:
https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/pironman5/en/latest/set_up/set_up_rpi_os.html

Then, install the required software:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git python3 python3-pip python3-setuptools

git clone https://github.com/sunfounder/pironman5.git
cd ~/pironman5
sudo python3 install.py

This will enable control of the RGB fans and the small monitor in the Pironman case.
