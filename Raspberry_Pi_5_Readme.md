## Setting Up Raspberry Pi 5 with Pironman 5 Case and Booting from NVMe M.2 SSD

### This guide will walk you through the steps to install and boot MX Linux on a Samsung 980 1TB NVMe M.2 SSD using the Pironman 5 case with a Raspberry Pi 5. The goal is to install the OS initially on the SD card, clone it to the SSD, and then boot from the SSD for improved speed and performance.

### Prerequisites:
- Raspberry Pi 5
- Pironman 5 case (assembled)
- Samsung 980 1TB NVMe M.2 SSD
- SD card with Raspberry Pi Imager (Headless setup)
- MX Linux image (mx23.4_rpi.img or your preferred OS image)

# Step 1: Install Raspberry Pi OS on the SD Card and boot from it
## Follow the detailed instruction outlined in 01-step file

# Step 2: Configuration After Booting from SSD
## Follow the detailed instruction outlined in 02-step file

### Now, before booting your Raspberry Pi 5 from the NVMe SSD, you need to decide how you want to use the systemâ€”either as a server accessed through SSH or with the full MX Linux GUI.

### Case 1: Headless Server (SSH Only)

### Case 2: MX Linux or any other Linux GUI OS
